# Module 5 Machine Learning Flatiron School Michael Noel Abhineet Kulkarni Data Science
My method used to solve the business problem of finding out how to classify people into two bins whether they make more than $50,000 or less than $50,000
is to employ a random forest classifier. Random Forests are good at running quickly and efficiently and getting accurate results. 
I got 85% accuracy with random forests. 

The order of my projects follows the OSEMN

1. Obtain Data - I obtained my data from a kaggle competition.
2. Scrub Data - I turned my data into numerical numbers to work with random forest models.
3. Explore Data - There was not a lot to explore
4. Model Data - I ran a random forest model
5. Interpret Data - I interpreted my model and did some exploring of my model.
